# Next.js Practice

A practice project exploring the Next.js 16 App Router, route groups, dynamic & catch-all segments, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** 16.2.6 (App Router + Turbopack)
- **React** 19.2.4
- **TypeScript** 5
- **Tailwind CSS** v4 (via `@tailwindcss/postcss`)
- **ESLint** 9 with `eslint-config-next`

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server (Turbopack)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run the production build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

## Completed So Far

- Bootstrapped Next.js 16 project with the App Router.
- Organized routes using **route groups** `(auth)` and `(user)` so each section can have its own layout without affecting the URL.
- Added **dynamic segments**: `/products/[productId]`, `/articles/[articleId]`.
- Added an **optional catch-all segment**: `/docs/[[...slug]]` with a scoped `not-found.tsx`.
- Added a **global** `not-found.tsx` for unmatched routes.
- Demonstrated **private folders** with `_private/` (not exposed as a route).
- Set up shared metadata (title template + description) in each layout.
- Configured **Tailwind CSS v4** via PostCSS (`@import "tailwindcss"` in `global.css`).
- Built an auth `Navbar` component reused across the `(auth)` group.
- Migrated the `(user)` layout and pages from inline styles to **Tailwind utility classes**.
- Added an `order-product` page demonstrating **programmatic navigation** via `useRouter()` in a Client Component.
- Added **`loading.tsx`** files at each route segment for streamed Suspense fallbacks during navigation.
- Built a shared **`<Loader />`** in `_components/loader.tsx` (inline spinner) reused by every `loading.tsx`, so only the page slot swaps while the shared layout (header/footer) stays mounted and interactive.
- Added an **`error.tsx`** boundary for the `(user)` group — catches runtime errors in any nested page and renders a fallback UI with **Try Again** and **Go Back** actions, isolating failures to that subtree.
- **Try Again** uses the `reset` prop from Next.js together with `router.refresh()` inside `startTransition` to re-render the failed segment without a full page reload.
- Simulated a server error in `/products` (random `throw new Error(...)`) to exercise the error boundary end-to-end.

## Notes

- Tailwind v4 uses a single `@import "tailwindcss";` entrypoint — the old `base`/`components`/`utilities` imports are no longer exported.
- In **Server Components**, route `params` and `searchParams` arrive as Promises and must be awaited. In **Client Components**, use the `use()` hook to unwrap them.
- `loading.tsx` is wrapped automatically in a React `<Suspense>` boundary by Next.js — no manual `<Suspense>` needed for route-level loading states.
- `error.tsx` must be a Client Component (`'use client'`); Next.js wraps the segment in a React error boundary and renders this file's fallback when an error is thrown below it.
- Next.js passes two props to `error.tsx`: `error` (the thrown error) and `reset` (a function that re-renders the segment). Wrapping `router.refresh() + reset()` in `startTransition` retries server-rendered content without losing client state elsewhere on the page.
- Next.js performs **automatic route-based code splitting**: only the chunks for the current route are shipped on initial load; `<Link>` prefetches destination chunks in the background. Use `next/dynamic` for component-level lazy loading inside a route.
